# Dialogs
In Qt dialog boxes are handled by the QDialog class. To create a new dialog
box simply create a new object of QDialog type passing in a parent widget, e.g.
QMainWindow, as its parent. \
Letâ€™s create our own QDialog. Weâ€™ll start with a simple skeleton app with a
button to press hooked up to a slot method.

```
import sys

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QDialog, QMainWindow, QPushButton


class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.setWindowTitle("My App")

        button = QPushButton("Press me for a dialog!")
        button.clicked.connect(self.button_clicked)
        self.setCentralWidget(button)

    def button_clicked(self, s):
        print("click", s)

        dlg = QDialog(self)
        dlg.setWindowTitle("?")
        dlg.exec_()


app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = MainWindow()
window.show()
app.exec_()
```

In the slot button_clicked (which receives the signal from the button press) we
create the dialog instance, passing our QMainWindow instance as a parent. This
will make the dialog a modal window of QMainWindow. This means the dialog
will completely block interaction with the parent window.

ðŸš€ Run [dialogs_1.py](https://github.com/phuoctan4141/python/blob/main/pythonGUIs/Basic%20PyQt5%20Features/Dialogs/dialogs_1.py)! Click the button and youâ€™ll see an empty dialog appear.

Once we have created the dialog, we start it using .exec_() - just like we did
for QApplication to create the main event loop of our application. Thatâ€™s not a
coincidence: when you exec the QDialog an entirely new event loop - specific
for the dialog - is created. \
**One event loop to rule them all**: *Remember I said there can only be one Qt event loop running at any time? I meant it! The QDialog completely blocks your application execution. Donâ€™t start a dialog and expect anything else to happen anywhere else in your app. Weâ€™ll see later how you can use multithreading to get you out of this pickle.* \
Like our very first window, this isnâ€™t very interesting. Letâ€™s fix that by adding a dialog title and a set of OK and Cancel buttons to allow the user to accept or reject the modal. \
To customize the QDialog we can subclass it.

```
class CustomDialog(QDialog):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):  # <1>
        super().__init__(parent)

        self.setWindowTitle("HELLO!")

        buttons = QDialogButtonBox.Ok | QDialogButtonBox.Cancel

        self.buttonBox = QDialogButtonBox(buttons)
        self.buttonBox.accepted.connect(self.accept)
        self.buttonBox.rejected.connect(self.reject)

        self.layout = QVBoxLayout()
        message = QLabel("Something happened, is that OK?")
        self.layout.addWidget(message)
        self.layout.addWidget(self.buttonBox)
        self.setLayout(self.layout)
```

In the above code, we first create our subclass of QDialog which weâ€™ve called
CustomDialog. As for the QMainWindow we customize it within the __init__ block
to ensure that our customizations are created as the object is created. First
we set a title for the QDialog using .setWindowTitle(), exactly the same as we
did for our main window. \
The next block of code is concerned with creating and displaying the dialog
buttons. This is probably a bit more involved than you were expecting.
However, this is due to Qtâ€™s flexibility in handling dialog button positioning
on different platforms. \
**Easy way out?**: *You could of course choose to ignore this and use a standard
QButton in a layout, but the approach outlined here ensures
that your dialog respects the host desktop standards (OK on
left vs. right for example). Messing around with these
behaviors can be incredibly annoying to your users, so I
wouldnâ€™t recommend it.* \
The first step in creating a dialog button box is to define the buttons want to
show, using namespace attributes from QDialogButtonBox. The full list of
buttons available is below:
| Button types |
| --- |
QDialogButtonBox.Ok
QDialogButtonBox.Open
QDialogButtonBox.Save
QDialogButtonBox.Cancel
QDialogButtonBox.Close
QDialogButtonBox.Discard
QDialogButtonBox.Apply
QDialogButtonBox.Reset
QDialogButtonBox.RestoreDefaults
QDialogButtonBox.Help
QDialogButtonBox.SaveAll
QDialogButtonBox.Yes
QDialogButtonBox.YesToAll
QDialogButtonBox.No
QDialogButtonBox.NoToAll
QDialogButtonBox.Abort
QDialogButtonBox.Retry
QDialogButtonBox.Ignore
QDialogButtonBox.NoButton
| --- |

These should be sufficient to create any dialog box you can think of. You can
construct a line of multiple buttons by OR-ing them together using a pipe (|).
Qt will handle the order automatically, according to platform standards. For
example, to show an OK and a Cancel button we used:
``` buttons = QDialogButtonBox.Ok | QDialogButtonBox.Cancel ``` \
