# Layouts

There are 4 basic layouts available in Qt, which are listed in the following table.
| Layout | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| QHBoxLayout | Linear horizontal layout |
| QVBoxLayout | Linear vertical layout |
| QGridLayout | In indexable grid XxY |
| QStackedLayout | Stacked (z) in front of one another |

There are three 2-dimensional layouts available in Qt. The QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout and QGridLayout. In addition there is also QStackedLayout which allows you to place widgets one on top of the other within the same space, yet showing only one layout at a time.

You can actually design and lay out your interface graphically using the Qt Designer, which we will cover later. Here we’re using code, as it’s simpler to understand and experiment with the underlying system.
